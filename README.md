# Insights:
1: Total customers are 7043, with the number of retained customers being 5174, and customers churned are 1869.
2:  The churn rate is 26.5%, which indicates that more than a quarter of customers are leaving.

4: About 16% of customers are senior citizens and the percentage of churned customers is 25.46%, which is quite high.
5: Customers using Fiber Optic have the highest churn rate (41.9%), compared to DSL (19%) and those with no internet service (7.4%). This suggests dissatisfaction among Fiber Optic users, possibly due to cost or service quality.
6: Customers on Month-to-Month contracts have the highest churn rate(42.7%), while those on One-Year or Two-Year contracts are much less likely to churn. Offering incentives to transition month-to-month customers to long-term contracts could help reduce churn.
